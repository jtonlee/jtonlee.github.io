  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>Hello my name is Justin Lee. I am taking a dive into the art world. The type of art I desire to create is art that helps grow awarness in my community. I grew up in Oakland, California where lots of senseless violence comes from. I wanted to make art that will show just how beutiful my city is but also show what is wrong with it. Oakland has always had a problem with violence but in recent years we are faceing a different challenges like gentrification, rent control, and homelessness. I know my city will get through these problems because everyone form Oakland just have a different thing in them that you don't seem to really get without living in the city. I hope my art will show this and will be a positive impact on people and my community to help and stand up to make the city a better.</p>
